# SQL_LeetCode

- I realized if I need to break into the Big Data space, SQL was the most desirable skill for that
- So during my 1-month break, I decided to dedicatedly use LeetCode for improving my SQL skills
- I was able to solve 138 questions involving a lot of Window Functions, Joins, Subqueries, etc.
- I also took a class on Postgres after this stint as it is the No. 1 industry choice
- Used this amazing extension [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) which automated GitHub integration so I can focus more on learning
