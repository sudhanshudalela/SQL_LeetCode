# SQL_LeetCode

- Realized that in order to break into the Big Data space, SQL was the most desirable skill
- Decided to dedicatedly use LeetCode for polishing SQL skills during Winter'21 break
- Was able to solve 138 questions having many unique applications involving Window Functions, Joins, Recursion, Subqueries, etc.
- Also took a class on Postgres after this stint as it is the No. 1 industry choice
- Used this amazing extension [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) which seamlessly pushed everything to GitHub
