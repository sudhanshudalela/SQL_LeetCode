# SQL_LeetCode

I realized if I need to break into the Big Data space, SQL was the most desirable skill for that
So during my 1-month break, I decided to dedicatedly use LeetCode for improving my SQL skills
I also took a class on Postgres after this stint as it is the No. 1 industry choice
Used this amazing Chrome extension [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) which automated the pushing process for me so I can focus more on learning
